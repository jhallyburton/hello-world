# hello-world
I'm a retired engineer who has decided to use Git as an archive of work I've done at home for my own amusement. I'll be making this work publicly available so it doesn't die with me. (Maybe it should, but that's debatable.)

All software comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. There is no guarantee whatsoever that it will do what you want, or is even the right software for your purposes. This software is intended for private noncommercial home use. It may fail at any time, in the most inexplicable ways. Hopefully you already knew that.
